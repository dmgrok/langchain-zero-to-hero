# Langchain and Langgraph Zero to Hero

Welcome to the **Langchain Zero to Hero** repository, a comprehensive guide designed to lead you from a beginner to an advanced user of Langchain. This repository integrates code from the official Langchain GitHub repository and additional community-sourced examples to illustrate practical applications and workflows using Langchain.

## Objective

- **Quickstart Learning:** Provide a hands-on, notebook-based introduction to Langchain's core functionalities.
- **Practical Demonstrations:** Showcase how to build, combine, and chain language model operations into working pipelines.
- **Balanced Approach:** Integrate best practices from both the official Langchain codebase and community-driven examples.

## Why Is This Necessary?

- **Bridging the Gap:** As the landscape of language model applications evolves rapidly, this guide brings together diverse resources to ease the learning curve for new users.
- **Real-World Applications:** Practical, code-driven examples are essential for understanding how to implement and experiment with Langchain effectively.
- **Community & Official Insights:** Merging ideas from both official sources and community contributions leads to more robust and innovative usage.

## How to Launch

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 or later:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Jupyter Notebook/Lab:** The quickstart is delivered via a Jupyter Notebook.

### Steps
